Build a solution so we can deploy new vanilla instances (Windows/Linux) using automation and ensuring predictable deployments. 

The solution must take into consideration we want to know when an instance has been deployed successfully or has failed. 

The vanilla instances must ensure the following is configured/installed:
1. snmp community string configured for "sendmeinfo"
2. Anti-virus is installed: name = "antivirus99.msi" or "antivirus.bin" location = je-bucket-99 ; accesskey = 12345 ; secretkey = abcde12345
3. Ensure the instance is upto date with the latest patches.
4. Set DNS settings to 10.10.10.10
5. Join the instance to the domain = domain99.local
6. Add local admin user
7. There should be an input parameter to enter the name of the server
8. Ensure input for server name reflects on build
9. Tag the instance with name = Env ; Value = Test
